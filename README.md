- 👋 Hi, I’m @dan-bailey
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development. Writing a lot of Python lately.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: GraphQL, Docker/Kubernetes, prepping for my [PCAP certification](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap), and learning to draw.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something cool.  What've you got?
- 📫 How to reach me: dbailey@danbailey.net or on Threads at @fontosaurus
- 📕 Reading: [Creating Short Fiction](https://amzn.to/40xRrkf) by Damon Knight, [The Art of Unit Testing](https://amzn.to/3CpEzEO) by Roy Osherove, and [Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://amzn.to/4jxrnyo) by Douglas R. Hofstadter.
- 💻 Blog: [DanBailey.net](https://danbailey.net) is where I noodle about stuff, mostly my productivity. It's so that I can be accountable to my probably two readers.  Seriously, who reads blogs anymore besides me?
